# Telecom Churn Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a Telecom Churn Prediction project. The goal of this project is to predict customer churn in a telecom dataset using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is located in the `data` folder. It includes various features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and customer churn labels.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hareeshram2002/telecom-churn-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash

   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   or

   Use Google Colab by uploading the notebook to your Google Drive.

2. Open the `Telecom_Churn_Prediction.ipynb` notebook.

3. Execute the cells in the notebook to run the analysis and train the machine learning model.

## Model

The trained model is saved in the `models` folder. The notebook includes code for training, evaluating, and saving the model.

## Results
